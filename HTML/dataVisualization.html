        <h2>What is Data Visualization ?</h2>
        <b>
            <p>Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets. The term is often used interchangeably with others, including information graphics, information visualization and statistical graphics.
             <br>
             Data visualization is the process of translating large data sets and metrics into charts, graphs and other visuals. The resulting visual representation of data makes it easier to identify and share real-time trends, outliers, and new insights about the information represented in the data.
            </p> 
            <h3>Examples--></h3>
            <b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cinema: Explaining a movie plot through data visualization
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 0;">Inception is an American film, directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2010, that focuses on the themes of dreams and reality. The movie’s hero, Cobb, is an “extractor”, an agent that can enter someone’s dreams and learn their secrets, who collaborates with others on industrial espionage missions.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Art: Analyzing the color palettes of great artworks
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Arthur Buxton has created a data visualization that shows an overview of the color palettes used by ten painters, including Monet, Gauguin, and Cézanne, over a period of ten years. These offer a new perspective on these artists, sorting them by the colors used rather than by art movement.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Philosophy: A visual depiction of ideas
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The data presented here is a direct reflection of concepts from everyday life. Ideas are presented and analyzed based on their significance, duration and the feelings that they evoke. Another interesting perspective on a common subject!

            <h2>Why we need Data Visualization? </h2>
            <p>Data visualization gives us a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs. This makes the data more natural for the human mind to comprehend and therefore makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within large data sets.
                <br>
                In advanced analytics, data scientists are creating machine learning algorithms to better compile essential data into visualizations that are easier to understand and interpret.
                <br>
                Specifically, data visualization uses visual data to communicate information in a manner that is universal, fast, and effective. This practice can help companies identify which areas need to be improved, which factors affect customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and what to do with specific products (where should they go and who should they be sold to). Visualized data gives stakeholders, business owners, and decision-makers a better prediction of sales volumes and future growth.

            <h2>Benefits of Data Visualization?</h2>
            <p>Data visualization positively affects an organization’s decision-making process with interactive visual representations of data. Businesses can now recognize patterns more quickly because they can interpret data in graphical or pictorial forms. 
              <br>
              Here are some more specific ways that data visualization can benefit an organization: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Correlations in Relationships:</h3>
                <p>Without data visualization, it is challenging to identify the correlations between the relationship of independent variables. By making sense of those independent variables, we can make better business decisions. </p>
            </li>
                <li><h3>Trends Over Time: </h3>
                <p>While this seems like an obvious use of data visualization, it is also one of the most valuable applications. It’s impossible to make predictions without having the necessary information from the past and present. Trends over time tell us where we were and where we can potentially go. 

                </p></li>
                <li><h3>Frequency: </h3>
                <p>Closely related to trends over time is frequency. By examining the rate, or how often, customers purchase and when they buy gives us a better feel for how potential new customers might act and react to different marketing and customer acquisition strategies.     
                </p></li>
                <li><h3>Examining the Market:  </h3>
                    <p>Data visualization takes the information from different markets to give you insights into which audiences to focus your attention on and which ones to stay away from. We get a clearer picture of the opportunities within those markets by displaying this data on various charts and graphs.             
                    </p></li>
                <li><h3>Risk and Reward:  </h3>
                    <p>Looking at value and risk metrics requires expertise because, without data visualization, we must interpret complicated spreadsheets and numbers. Once information is visualized, we can then pinpoint areas that may or may not require action.           
                    </p></li>
                <li><h3>Reacting to the Market: </h3>
                    <p>The ability to obtain information quickly and easily with data displayed clearly on a functional dashboard allows businesses to act and respond to findings swiftly and helps to avoid making mistakes.  </p></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Real Time Application Data Visualization:</h2>
            <p>Real-time data visualization takes visuals to the next level by letting you update charts and graphs in real-time. Having real-time data available helps stakeholders to make better decisions that are based on actual data rather than on intuition.
                <br>
                Data visualisation tools make it easy to view and comprehend trends, outliers, and patterns in data by utilising visual components like charts, graphs, and maps.

            </p>
            <h2>How do we build real-time visualizations?</h2>
            <p>At its core, a real-time visualization is made up of two components: a stream of data and a user interface.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Stream of Data</h3>
                <p>A stream of data is a constant flow of data where data packets is sent whenever that data is updated. This could be weather forecasts, stock prices, revenue, or Tweets, pretty much any data group that changes over time. Because a stream of data is active, it needs to have persistence, an open connection that allows data to be transferred freely.</p></li>
                <li><h3>User Interface</h3>
                <p>A real-time visualization requires a flexible, interactive user interface where changes are easily displayed based on changes sent from the stream of data.
